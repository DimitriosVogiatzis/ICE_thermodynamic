# ICE_thermodynamic
A filling-evacuation model of a direct injection diesel engine is solved for different operation points. 

A mathematical model of the thermodynamic cycle of a direct injection diesel internal combustion engine is solved.

The thermodynamic cycle contains the intake phase, the fuel injection, the combustion pahse and the exhaust phase 
by taking into consideration the intake and exhaust overlap. 

This models simulates: 
  1. the process of mixture exchange for the cylinder
  2. the energy release during the combustion 
  3. the heat transfer of the cylinder chamber to the cylinder sleeves - walls
while assuming constant steady-state conditions at the intake and exhaust volumes correspondingly - no pressure waves and resonance effects.

The models solves with a timestep of 0.1 crank-angle degrees.
